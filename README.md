# Calculator App Frontend

This repository contains the frontend implementation of a simple calculator app developed in Swift. The main focus of this project was to practice auto layout techniques using constraints, size classes, and orientation support. Additionally, it covers concepts such as alignment and pinning, using containers for more fine-grained controls, and utilizing stack views.

## Features

- Clean and intuitive user interface.
- Support for various device sizes, orientations, and size classes.
- Responsive layout with proper alignment and spacing.
- Efficient use of stack views for organizing UI elements.

## Auto Layout Techniques

The calculator app frontend showcases the following auto layout techniques:

- **Constraints**: Auto layout constraints are used to define the position, size, and relationships between UI elements.

- **Size Classes and Orientation**: The app supports different device sizes, orientations, and size classes by adapting the layout dynamically.

- **Alignment and Pinning**: Constraints are used to align UI elements horizontally, vertically, or to pin them to specific edges.

- **Containers**: Containers such as stack views are utilized to achieve a more organized and structured layout, making it easier to manage and maintain the UI.

## Getting Started

To use the calculator app frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open the Xcode project file (`Calculator Layout iOS13.xcodeproj`) in Xcode.

3. Choose a simulator or connect your iOS device as the deployment target.

4. Build and run the app using the "Play" button in the Xcode toolbar.
